Hello! I am a PhD-student at the Department of Mathematics of [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html) under the supervision of [Moritz Weber](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/weber-moritz/team/moritz-weber.html). Before that I was a master's studies at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb/index.de.jsp). My research interests are in quantum graphs, quantum groups and their applications in quantum information theory.
